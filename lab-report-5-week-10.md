## Lab Report 5- Week 10
### Comparing Results

I first added code to a file called `script.sh` that prints the file names and runs `java MarkdownParse` on each file. 

In my own markdown-parse repository and the given repository, I ran the tests in common-mark-spec and copied the results into a text file using the command `bash script.sh > results.txt`. I compared the results from the two text files by using the command `diff myMarkdown-parse/results.txt lab9-markdown-parse/results.txt`. 

The first line tells us the line number in `results.txt`. Then, the output from `results.txt` in my repo is followed by a line followed by the output from `results.txt` in the given repo. Because the script file printed the file names, I was able to find the corresponding files with the tests.
